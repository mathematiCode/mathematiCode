- 👋 Hi, I’m @mathematiCode
- 👀 I’m interested in software that can be used to make learning and teaching (especially math) more enjoyable. I am former math teacher of 5 years hoping to get a job at an edtech company.
- 💻 Tech Stack: React, Vanilla JS, CSS, Styled Components
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a complex math puzzle game in React using Dnd-kit for Drag and Drop and motion for animations. It's not done but you can check it out here: https://frectangles.netlify.app/ 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to math education.
