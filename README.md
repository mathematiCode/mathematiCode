- 👋 Hi, I’m @mathematiCode
- 👀 I’m interested in software that can be used to make learning and teaching (especially math) more enjoyable. I am former math teacher of 5 years hoping to get a job at an edtech company. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React through the Joy of React Course [https://www.joyofreact.com/]. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to math education.

- 🦋 BlueSky: [@mathcoder.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/mathcoder.bsky.social)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am still early in my learning of web development but I would say my current strengths are CSS and anything related to math visuals.
