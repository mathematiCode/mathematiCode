- 👋 Hi, I’m @mathematiCode
- 👀 I’m interested in software that can be used to make learning and teaching (especially math) more enjoyable. I am former math teacher of 5 years hoping to get a job at an edtech company. 
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my foundations in HTML, CSS, and JS. I am starting a bootcamp in July 2024 and am making projects to get a headstart. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to math education.
- 📫 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianna-messineo/
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am still early in my learning of web development but I would say my current strengths are CSS and anything related to math visuals.
   For example: https://mathvisuals.netlify.app/
- I am also interested in learning database design but that's still a few months away...
